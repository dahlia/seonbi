Seonbi changelog
================

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on September 8, 2024.

 -  Introduced GitHub action `dahlia/seonbi/setup` to install Seonbi during
    GitHub Actions workflow.

 -  Since this version, it supports GHC 9.4.* at most.

 -  The `iconv` flag became ignored on Windows, because the flag had never
    worked on Windows.

 -  Previously, `ContentType` type (and `-t`/`--content-type` in CLI and
    `"contentType"` field in HTTP API) was a mere case-insensitive string.
    Now, it is loosely structured so that it can contain parameters.  You can
    treat it as a media type (MIME type).

    For example, `text/markdown` and `text/markdown; variant=Original` both
    use the same parser and formatter under the hood.

     -  `Text.Seonbi.ContentTypes.ContentType` type became an alias of
        `Network.HTTP.Media.MediaType` type (was `CI Text`).
     -  The type of `Text.Seonbi.ContentTypes.contentTypeFromText` function
        became `Text -> Maybe ContentType` (was `Text -> ContentType`).
     -  `Text.Seonbi.ContentTypes.transformWithContentType` function became
        able to handle media types with parameters, and now it falls back
        more-specific media types to less-specific media types if there is no
        exactly matched one.

 -  For `text/html` and `application/xhtml+xml` formats, some obsolete HTML
    tags are no more ignored, but now recognized as valid HTML tags.  Here are
    the list of added tags:

     -  `<center>`
     -  `<font>`
     -  `<nobr>`
     -  `<strike>`
     -  `<xmp>`

    Haskell API-wise, the following constructors were added to
    the `Text.Seonbi.Html.Tag.HtmlTag` type:

     -  `Center`
     -  `Font`
     -  `NoBR`
     -  `Strike`
     -  `XMP`

 -  Deno module became possible to use an already deployed Seonbi API server
    instead of spawning a local API server.  The `new Seonbi()` constructor
    now takes `{ apiUrl: string }` besides existing configuration forms.

 -  Updated the *Standard Korean Language Dictionary* data
    (*data/ko-kr-stdict.tsv*) to the revision 2024-09.


Version 0.3.6
-------------

Released on February 16, 2023.

 -  The `iconv` flag became ignored on Windows, because the flag had never
    worked on Windows.

 -  Fixed a bug that `seonbi.exe --help` had suddenly terminated with
    the below error message on Windows:  [[#30]]

    ~~~~
    <stdout>: commitBuffer: invalid argument (invalid character)
    ~~~~

Version 0.3.5
-------------

Released on February 13, 2023.

 -  Official builds for Windows now contain required dynamic libraries (_*.dll_)
    besides executables (*seonbi.exe* & *seonbi-api.exe*).  [[#2]]
 -  Fixed a bug where Sino-Korean words that were not listed in the dictionary
    sometimes had been inaccurately phoneticized so that Initial Sound Law
    (頭音法則) had been applied to non-initial hanja of a word too. [[#20]]
 -  Updated the *Standard Korean Language Dictionary* data
    (*data/ko-kr-stdict.tsv*) to the revision 2023-02.

Version 0.3.4
-------------

Released on January 18, 2023.

 -  Updated the *Standard Korean Language Dictionary* data
    (*data/ko-kr-stdict.tsv*) to the revision 2022-12.


Version 0.3.3
-------------

Released on September 9, 2022.

 -  Updated the *Standard Korean Language Dictionary* data
    (*data/ko-kr-stdict.tsv*) to the revision 2022-09.
 -  Fixed a bug that Sino-Korean words are not phoneticized to Korean custom
    readings (習慣音) according to folk readings (俗音) and erroneous
    readings (訛音).  Now such words are phoneticized to the most usual readings
    according to *Standard Korean Language Dictionary*.  For example,
    *困難* is no more phoneticized to *곤난* but *곤란* instead. [[#22]]
